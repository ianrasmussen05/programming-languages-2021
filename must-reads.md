# "Must Reads"

I list some books that stood the test of time and are less technical and of wider interest, more foundational than practical. Not required reading, but great background if you like to read widely.

- Hofstadter: [Goedel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach). A wide ranging book bringing together history, art, music and computer science. Contains a lot of rewriting and computability theory. The reader ends up with a proof of Goedel's incompleteness theorem, without going through a technical and advanced course of logic.

- Smullyan: [To Mock a Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Mock_a_Mockingbird). Presents a deep but playful account of combinatory logic and the lambda-calculus. Entirely formulated as a sequence of logic puzzles that should be accessible to everybody with a taste for these kind of mind teasers. If you do, also check out other books by Smullyan.

- Petzold: [The Annotated Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Annotated_Turing). Goes through Turing's famous paper line by line. Can be read from a technical point of view, but one can also browse it lightly and just pick out the anecdotes.

- Doxiadis, Papadimitriou: [Logicomix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicomix). This graphical novel about the life of Bertrand Russell introduces many of the main players in the history of logic and computing in the early 19 hundreds. Co-authored by one of the most influential contemporary theoretical computer scientists.
