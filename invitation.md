You already know some programming languages (such as Python, Java, or C++) and you are able to teach yourself a new one. But did you ever wonder how to design your own programming language? How would you even get started on a project like this? 

After this course you should be able to develop your own small programming language. We will learn how to define the syntax of a programming language using a context-free grammar, how to use a parser generator and how to write an interpreter by recursion on abstract syntax.

- Our first programming language will just be high-school arithmetic and the interpreter will be a simple calculator. To appreciate that even this is not such an easy task, I invite you to implement a calculator in your favourite programming language before we start the course. (The challenge consists in extracting from the input string the relevant information about numbers, operations and order of operations. For example, as you will remember from high-school algebra, the order of the operations in the input string can be very different from the order in which the interpreter has to evaluate them.) 
- Our second example, will be the smallest proper programming language, lambda calculus. For this we will need to learn about variable binding and recursion. 
- Finally, we extend lambda calculus to a mixed-paradigm language including higher-order functions, recursion, assignments, loops, pointers, and arrays.

On the way, we will introduce various theoretical concepts that underpin Programming Languages and open windows to topics in programming languages research.

We will also have the opportunity to touch on philosophical questions such as "What is Computation?", "What is Meaning?", "What is Information?", "What is an Algorithm?" and discuss whether it is possible to give a precise and satisfactory answer.
